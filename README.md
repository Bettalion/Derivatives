A simple program that visualises how the derivative works.

# Things that can be changed:

The span of x START->END ([ELENGTH,SLENGTH])
The difference in x when doing
  the gradient of the secant (DELTA)
The function that is done to x (fx)line 22
The derivative should be changed to match 
  the derivative of function supplied (dx)line 38

You can also use the main function to repeat for
   different values of delta, span of x and an option of 
   0, prints nothing to the console
   1, prints the inaccuracies between secant and derivative
   2, prints the inaccuracies between secant and derivative 
      and logs them to a file
